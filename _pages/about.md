I am a Senior Data Scientist at Home Partners of America. HPA is a portfolio company of Blackstone, based in Chicago, IL. HPA specializes in rent-to-own single family homes as well as traditional rentals in several markets throughout the United States. I own the "Resident Experience" workstream. My team works closely with HPA's senior leadership to develop analytically driven strategies that will further the satisfaction and success of our residents. We care primarily about the resident experience and we look for opportunities within our lease operations to make life as good as possible for them. While some Data Science units may view themselves as 'internal consultants' to the business leaders at their company, we see ourselves as thought-partners who hold just as much stake in the success of our residents as the leaders of the company do. This makes collaboration much more meaningful for us and we thrive by having a close pulse on the operations in addition to the data coming out of them.

I've been a leader in major business and analytical initiatives to improve our resident experience. These include but are not limited to:
* Programmatically designing simulations of call center incoming/ougoing volume to improve the "Answered Call %", resulting in rates increasing from ~50% to ~90% and wait times dropping from 45-60 mins to ~5 mins.
* Experimental design and eventual overhaul of resident experience strategy and success metric definition using 'account management' style relationship building. 
* Pioneering metric definition, reporting orchestration, and utilization of data for machine learning models from resident communication data.
* Software design and development of task management API's that integrate with our operational source data. These boards are used by operational units to efficiently and proactively and reactively communicate with residents. We collect reporting data from these boards to iteratively improve processes and build models to predict resident success/happiness.

My background is in theoretical mathematics and applied statistics, particularly probability theory. I passed Exam P/1 from the Society of Actuaries as an undergraduate mathematics student. I would then go on to graduate from FGCU with a 3.9 GPA in mathematics and statistics. Technical skills include Python, AWS, Git, SQL, R, OOP, and using these for building ML models and pipelines.
