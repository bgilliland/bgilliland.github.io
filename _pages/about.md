My name is Blake and I am an aspiring Data Scientist who is passionate about problem solving and data-oriented solutions. I currently am on ALDI's Network Planning Team in their National Supply Chain Management department as a Data Analyst. I have a young but strong background with Probability and its applications. I am adept with statistical modeling techniques such as Regression Analysis, Time Series Analysis, and Experimental Design \& Statistical Testing.

The tools I prefer to use in my workflow are R, SQL, Tableau, and Hadoop/Snowflake, as well as Git for version control. I am learning Python because it is the number one language in the world and is crucial to know for scalable model deployment. R is unquestionably my favorite tool to use for Data Science and I am taking courses on DataCamp so that I can reach my goal of being an expert with R for Data Science.

I graduated from Florida Gulf Coast University (FGCU) with a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics and a minor in Statistics (GPA: 3.9). As an undergraduate I had many statistical research opportunities including deriving nonparametric density estimators via wavelet transform, investigating the probabilities and strategies involved in dice games, and analyzing Learning Assistant impact on student learning at FGCU. I was elected as the Vice President of FGCU's Mathematics Club in 2018 and continued to serve up through my graduating semester. I passed Exam P/1 from the Society of Actuaries for my knowledge of Probability Theory which demonstrates the high level to which I understand the theory and applications of various probabilistic concepts. 

My short term goal is to complete the 'R for Data Science' career path on DataCamp and implement the things I learn into my workflows and new projects. My long term goal is to continue to advance my career towards leadership roles in Data Science.
