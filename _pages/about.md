## Skills
I have strong engineering skills with object oriented design in Python and use of version control with Git. I like to write my own modules for tasks that require reproducibility or when they are highly repeatable. I also work with cloud computing tools and software such as Fargate, Lambda, ECS, and EC2 in AWS. This, paired with my knowledge of applied statistical methods and machine learning algorithms, makes me a versatile data scientist that can solve many kinds of analytical problems up and down the analytical workflow. On top of this, I have very strong leadership, communication, and relationship building skills which allow me to interface with non technical audiences extremely effectively. They also set me up for success as a people leader in a data science organization, which I have proved to be true in my time at HPA (discussed next).

## Current Role
I am a Team Lead Data Scientist, leading multiple associate data scientists, at Home Partners of America for the Resident Success workstream. It is my responsibility to closely engage with my team so that they are empowered to boldly take on complex analytical problems and do so with a strong sense of ownership and collaboration. I do this by giving transparent and candid feedback and ensuring they know they can give me the same feedback so that I can lead them the way that they need to get the most out of them. We are open minded to new ideas and approaches that allow us to get as close to optimality as possible, without trading off time constraints. While some Data Science units may view themselves as 'internal consultants' to the business leaders at their company, we see ourselves as thought-partners who hold just as much stake in the success of our residents as the leaders of the company do. This makes collaboration much more meaningful for us and we thrive by having a close pulse on the operations in addition to the data coming out of them.

HPA is a portfolio company of Blackstone, based in Chicago, IL. HPA specializes in rent-to-own single-family homes as well as traditional rentals in several markets throughout the United States. My team works closely with HPA's senior leadership to develop analytically driven strategies that will further the satisfaction and success of our residents. We care primarily about the resident experience and we look for opportunities within our lease operations to make life as good as possible for them. Some projects and their impact to the business are as follows:

* Optimize call routing logic, improving Answer Rate (50-% → 85+%) and lowering Wait Time (30 mins
→ 2 mins)
* Classify the resident experience via ML algorithms and observe their differences in company KR’s
including Rent Collection (+3%∆ ’good’ vs ’bad’) and Renewal Decision (-5%∆ ’good’ vs ’bad’)
* Design/deploy Renewal Prioritization model, rank ordering and classifying residents based on delin-
quency and ResEx so that an effective renewal strategy can be utilized on various cohorts
* Design/build Asana task API client for task management automation, whereby stakeholders have an
automated workflow without a heavy software lift and data can collected for reporting on their processes

## Background
My background is in theoretical mathematics and applied statistics, particularly probability theory. I passed Exam P/1 from the Society of Actuaries as an undergraduate. I then went on to graduate from FGCU with a 3.9 GPA in mathematics and statistics. My first role out of college was in the Logistics department at ALDI as part of the Network Planning team where we used data science to find gaps/inefficiencies of our supply chain, particularly with the shipping and warehouse stocking practices. After some time there I found an opportunity for a more senior data science position at Discover Financial. In this role, I collaborated with data engineers and other scientists to curate a data product consisting of specific types of merchant information that is licensed to other financial institutions, primarily banks. Finally, I found HPA and have been there since April 2022 and have been fortunate to be promoted to a management position after a lot of success in the Resident Success workstream.
