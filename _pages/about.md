I am a business leader as well as an analytical leader at Home Partners of America. In my role as Data Science Manager for HPA's Resident Experience workstream I hunt down opportunities for efficiency gains and operational gaps that only a data scientist would be able to identify. I project plan, project manage, execute & delegate tasks, and regularly collaborate with the executives that run the ResEx workstream to ensure we remain highly data driven up and down the board. HPA is a portfolio company of Blackstone, based in Chicago, IL. They specialize in rent-to-own single-family homes as well as traditional rentals in several markets throughout the United States. 

My team works closely with HPA's senior leadership to develop analytically driven strategies, such as predictive modeling, Bayesian statistical methods, API development, AB tests, algorithmic design, and data visualization, that will further the satisfaction and success of our residents. We care primarily about the resident experience and we look for opportunities within our lease operations to make life as good as possible for them. 

It is my responsibility to closely engage with my team, which includes several direct reports, so that they are empowered to boldly take on complex analytical problems and do so with a strong sense of ownership and collaboration. I do this by giving transparent and candid feedback and ensuring they know they can do the same with me so that I can help them grow and maximize their potential as a team. We are open minded to new ideas and approaches that allow us to get as close to optimality as possible, without trading off time constraints. While some Data Science units may view themselves as 'internal consultants' to the business leaders at their company, we see ourselves as thought-partners who hold just as much stake in the success of our residents as the leaders of the company do. This makes collaboration much more meaningful for us and we thrive by having a close pulse on the operations in addition to the data coming out of them.

Before HPA, I served as the senior data scientist for Discover Financial's DCX data product in their Payment Services division. This product is sold to external businesses that make use of merchant information, such as business names and addresses and MCC codes, to verify transactions from their own consumer base. My role was to ensure that the data was accurate and ready for production use. We did this by building statistical models to predict incorrect classes via ML algorithms such as boosted trees. Before Discover, I was apart of ALDI's logistics department where I served as a data scientist in their supply chain team where my focus was on cost reduction via waste elimination strategies via predictive analytics including time series forecasts and regression analysis.

Some projects and their impact to the business are as follows:

– Resident Partner Program - Conducted A/B test to measure impact on the resident experience of
overhauled ResComm strategy, resulting in CSAT 40% → 60% & NPS 30 → 52.
– Asana API Client - Designed, engineered, and productionalized Python API via AWS which connects
legacy data with third party task management tool used by entire company, resulting in $1m+ recovered
rental revenue, 1k+ man-hours gained, 10% reduction in resident touch-points.
– Resident Experience Prediction - Classification models built to predict bad residents experience resulting
in reduction of escalations by 10% and High Cost maintenance by $100k+.
– Lease Renewal Prioritization - Regression Modeling employed to prioritize lease renewal execution op-
portunities resulting in $500k+ saved rental revenue.
– Telephony Routing Optimization - Custom algorithms developed to identify bottlenecks in call routing
system resulting in Answer Rate (50% → 85+%) and Wait Times lowered (30 mins → 2 mins).
– Resident Experience Segmentation - Implemented unsupervised clustering algorithms to segment resi-
dents into ‘good’/‘bad’ resident experience clusters resulting in new company KR’s and resident success
strategies, and tracked in an executive-level PowerBI report.

## Skills
I have strong engineering skills with object oriented design in Python and use of version control with Git. I also work with AWS cloud computing services Fargate, Lambda, ECS, and EC2. This, paired with my deep knowledge of mathematics, probability, applied statistical methods, Bayesian models, data visualization, and machine learning algorithms makes me a versatile data scientist that can solve many kinds of problems up and down the analytical workflow spectrum and across industries. On top of this, I have very strong leadership, communication, and relationship building skills. They have set me up for success both as a people leader in a data science organization as well as a business leader alongside executives looking to harness the power of data science to improve and understand their own processes.

## Background
My background is in mathematics and applied statistics, particularly probability theory. I passed Exam P from the Society of Actuaries as an undergraduate. I then went on to graduate from FGCU with a 4.0 GPA in mathematics and statistics. My interests are primarily with Bayesian statistics, predictive modeling, and AB testing/Experimental design.
