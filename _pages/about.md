My name is Blake and I am a Senior Data Science Analyst at Discover Financial Services. I am in the Payments organization on the Global Network Analytics team where we are owners and solutioners of a merchant data product called DCX. We focus on data profiling, research, accuracy monitoring, process design, and modeling design. We use cloud-based solutions which include Snowflake, R, Python, SAS, and Airflow in order to improve DCX so that our clients are satisfied and to increase its marketability as an effective merchant data solution for multiple use-cases. This drives hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue per year.

I have a young but strong background with Probability and its applications. I passed the P Exam from the Society of Actuaries in September 2019. I have knowledge of statistical modeling techniques such as Regression Analysis, Time Series Analysis, and Experimental Design \& Statistical Testing and my goal is to gain more experience implementing these techniques in a production environment.

The tools I prefer to use in my workflow are R, Python, Snowflake, and Tableau, as well as Git for version control. R is unquestionably my favorite tool to use for Data Science! I am taking courses for these and other tools on DataCamp so that I can master my craft as a Data Scientist and advance my career.

I graduated from Florida Gulf Coast University (FGCU) with a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics and a minor in Statistics (GPA: 3.9). As an undergraduate I had many statistical research opportunities including deriving nonparametric density estimators via wavelet transform, investigating the probabilities and strategies involved in dice games, and analyzing Learning Assistant impact on student learning at FGCU. I was elected as the Vice President of FGCU's Mathematics Club in 2018 and continued to serve up through my graduating semester. I passed Exam P/1 from the Society of Actuaries for my knowledge of Probability Theory which demonstrates the high level to which I understand the theory and applications of various probabilistic concepts.
