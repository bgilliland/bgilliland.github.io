My name is Blake and I am a Data Scientist who is passionate about problem solving and data-oriented solutions. I currently am on ALDI's Network Planning Team in their National Supply Chain Management department as a Lead Data Specialist. I am enjoying learning about Supply Chain analytics, and the business of Logistics in general, especially in the context of the well-oiled machine that is ALDI.
 
I am passionate about Data Science because data is the only objective information out there and I think it is important to be able to understand the patterns and truths it has to offer beneath the surface. I consider it my responsibility to practice it with high integrity.

I graduated from Florida Gulf Coast University (FGCU) with a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics and a minor in Statistics (GPA: 3.9). I am highly skilled with SQL, Tableau, R, Alteryx, Hadoop, AutoIT, and Excel. I am learning Python and would like to learn SAS and VBA. R is unquestionably my favorite software/language and I am taking courses on DataCamp so that I can reach my goal of being an expert with R for Data Science.

As an undergraduate I had many statistical research opportunities including deriving nonparametric density estimators via wavelet transform, investigating the probabilities and strategies involved in dice games, and analyzing Learning Assistant impact on student learning at FGCU. I was elected as the Vice President of FGCU's Mathematics Club in 2018 and continued to serve up through my graduating semester. I passed Exam P/1 from the Society of Actuaries for my knowledge of Probability Theory which demonstrates the high level to which I understand the theory and applications of various probabilistic concepts. 

My short term goal is to complete the 'R for Data Science' career path on DataCamp and implement the things I learn into my workflows and new projects. My long term goal is to continue to advance my career towards leadership roles in Data Science.
