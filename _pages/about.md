My name is Blake and I am a Senior Data Scientist at Home Partners of America. HPA is a portfolio company of Blackstone that specializes in rent-to-own single family homes in several markets throughout the United States. Our headquarters is in downtown Chicago, IL. I am on the Operations Analytics team where we focus on maintenance of the homes, communication with residents, and resident underwriting, among other operational priorities.

We primarily use Python and SQL for our analyses, though sometimes I may whip up a nice R script if I am in the mood. We use AWS for deployment and I am working on getting certified as a developer with AWS.

I have a young but strong background with Probability and its applications. I passed the P Exam from the Society of Actuaries in September 2019. I have knowledge of statistical modeling techniques such as Regression Analysis, Time Series Analysis, and Experimental Design \& Statistical Testing and my goal is to gain more experience implementing these techniques in a production environment.

I graduated from Florida Gulf Coast University (FGCU) with a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics and a minor in Statistics (GPA: 3.9). As an undergraduate I had many statistical research opportunities including deriving nonparametric density estimators via wavelet transform, investigating the probabilities and strategies involved in dice games, and analyzing Learning Assistant impact on student learning at FGCU. I was elected as the Vice President of FGCU's Mathematics Club in 2018 and continued to serve up through my graduating semester. I passed Exam P/1 from the Society of Actuaries for my knowledge of Probability Theory which demonstrates the high level to which I understand the theory and applications of various probabilistic concepts.
