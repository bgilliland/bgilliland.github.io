My name is Blake and I am 21 years old. I graduated from Florida Gulf Coast University (FGCU) with a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics and a minor in Statistics (GPA: 3.9). I was elected as the Vice President of FGCU's Mathematics Club in 2018 and continued to serve up through my graduating semester. 

I am passionate about data science and data analysis because data is the only objective information in this world and I think it is important to be able to understand the patterns and truths it has to offer beneath the surface. I consider it my responsibility to practice it with high integrity.

Probability Theory is my favorite branch of mathematics and for this reason I am pursuing a career in Data Science, whether it be Analytics or Actuarial Science I am open to any related opportunity. 

I passed Exam P/1 from the Society of Actuaries for my knowledge of Probability Theory which demonstrates the high level to which I understand the theory and applications of various probabilistic concepts. 

My short term goal is to obtain an entry level data science or data analysis position in Chicago, IL in the summer of 2020. I  want to do this with a company who is seeking a critical thinker who is self-driven, highly motivated to learn, team-oriented, and is of high integrity.
