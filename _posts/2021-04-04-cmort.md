## Background

This data comes from the `astsa` package in R, developed by Dr. David
Stoffer who is one of the foremost Statisticians specializing in Time
Series Analysis.

## Description

Average weekly cardiovascular mortality in Los Angeles County; 508
six-day smoothed averages obtained by filtering daily values over the 10
year period 1970-1979.

``` r
library(astsa)
data("cmort")
tsplot(cmort,
       main = "Cardiovascular Mortality in Los Angeles (1970-1979)",
       ylab = "Mortality",
       xlab = "Year") 
```

Note that there is a slight downward trend in the data as the city gets
a better hold on pollution, indicating a non-constant mean. This breaks
our assumption of stationarity. So, we difference the data to stabilize
the mean.

``` r
tsplot(diff(cmort),
       main = "Differenced Cardiovascular Mortality in Los Angeles (1970-1979)",
       ylab = "Differenced Mortality",
       xlab = "Year")
```

This is more like it! We have a stationary series and by observation we
see the variance is stable, so no need for a logarithmic transformation.

## P/ACF & Model Selection

In order to know the parameters of our ARIMA model, we need to examine
its P/ACF graphs.

``` r
invisible(acf2(diff(cmort)))
```

Note that the ACF trails off and the PACF cuts off at lag 1. We don’t
see any seasonality. Additionally, the oscillatory nature of the ACF
indicates that the model parameter will be negative.

This implies an ARIMA(1,1,0) model. We can use the `sarima()` function
using these parameters.

``` r
sarima(cmort,1,1,0,no.constant = T)
```

    ## $fit

    ## Call:
    ## stats::arima(x = xdata, order = c(p, d, q), seasonal = list(order = c(P, D, 
    ##     Q), period = S), include.mean = !no.constant, transform.pars = trans, fixed = fixed, 
    ##     optim.control = list(trace = trc, REPORT = 1, reltol = tol))
    ## 
    ## Coefficients:

    ##       -0.5064
    ## s.e.   0.0383

    ## sigma^2 estimated as 33.81:  log likelihood = -1612.07,  aic = 3228.13

    ## ar1  -0.5064 0.0383 -13.2224       0
    ##

This model seems to fit well. The residuals are white noise and don’t
have any significant autocorrelation left over. Further evidence of this
can be seen from the high p-values in the series of Ljung-Box
statistics. We also satisfy the normality condition as can be seen in
the Q-Q plot.

The model parameter is estimated to be *ϕ* =  − 0.5064.

However, after reconsidering the ACF plot, one might argue that the PACF
trails off instead of cutting off. In this case we would have an
ARIMA(1,1,1) model. Let’s see how this compares to the current model.

``` r
sarima(cmort,1,1,1,no.constant = T)
```

    ## Call:
    ## stats::arima(x = xdata, order = c(p, d, q), seasonal = list(order = c(P, D, 
    ##     Q), period = S), include.mean = !no.constant, transform.pars = trans, fixed = fixed, 
    ##     optim.control = list(trace = trc, REPORT = 1, reltol = tol))
    ## 
    ## Coefficients:
    ##           ar1      ma1
    ##       -0.3779  -0.1717
    ## s.e.   0.0882   0.0967
    ## 
    ## sigma^2 estimated as 33.61:  log likelihood = -1610.58,  aic = 3227.15
    ## 
    ## $degrees_of_freedom
    ## [1] 505
    ## 
    ## $ttable
    ##     Estimate     SE t.value p.value
    ## ar1  -0.3779 0.0882 -4.2866  0.0000
    ## ma1  -0.1717 0.0967 -1.7749  0.0765

    ## 
    ## $BIC
    ## [1] 6.390218

They perform nearly identically well, and based on the Principle of
Parsimony we should choose the simpler model, which is the ARIMA(1,1,0)
model.

## Forecasting

We can forecast this data now that we know the dynamics of the data.

``` r
invisible(sarima.for(cmort,n.ahead = 12,1,1,0))
```

Notice how wide the bands are for the 90% and 95% C.I.’s. This is no
surprise since the original data is highly variable.
