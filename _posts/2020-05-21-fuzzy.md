## Background

I completed Maven Analytic’s ‘Advanced SQL + MySQL for Analytics &
Business Intelligence’ course. During this course, there were 2 projects
we were to complete to get simulated experience with, not only the
advanced SQL skills taught in the body of the course, but also in the
context of a business setting. The relational database,
mavenfuzzyfactory, was imported into MySQL Workbench and used throughout.

I played the role of a data analyst for a new online retailer, Maven
Fuzzy Factory. They make stuffed animals. In this database, we had info
dealing with website sessions, website pageviews, products, orders,
order items, and refunds. The board of directors and executives needed
answers to some questions to see if the business was growing and doing
so efficiently.

The analysis was performed in MySQL Workbench and the reporting as
follows was done using an R Markdown file in R Studio by connecting to
the database using the `RMariaDB` R Package and using SQL chunks.

## Midterm Project

Some of the types of inquiries and requests I recieved involve:

  - Analyzing Traffic Sources (Conversion Rates, Bid Optimization,
    Traffic Source Trending)
  - Analyzing Website Performance (Analyzing Top Pages & Entry Pages,
    Bounce Rates & Landing Page Tests, Landing Page Trend Analysis,
    Conversion Funnels & Testing Conversion Paths)

These are the questions that I was requested to get answers on for the
midterm project, along with the code I wrote and its
output.

## Objective 1: Pull monthly trends for ‘gsearch sessions’ and ‘order’ so that we can showcase the growth there. (In terms of Website Session volume, Order volume, and Conversion Rate)

(Note: ‘gsearch’ is a UTM parameter that indicates if a potential
customer found the website via the ‘gsearch’ search engine)

``` sql
SELECT
DATE_FORMAT(website_sessions.created_at, '%Y/%m') AS yr_mo,

COUNT(DISTINCT website_sessions.website_session_id) AS sessions,
COUNT(DISTINCT orders.order_id) AS orders,
COUNT(DISTINCT orders.order_id)/COUNT(DISTINCT website_sessions.website_session_id) AS order_rate

FROM website_sessions
LEFT JOIN orders
ON website_sessions.website_session_id = orders.website_session_id
WHERE website_sessions.utm_source = 'gsearch'
-- AND website_sessions.created_at < '2012-11-28'
GROUP BY 1;
```

Evidently our Session volume and Conversion Rate has been increasing
steadily since the inception of the business, exactly what we would want
to
see.

### Objective 2: Get a monthly trend for ‘gsearch’ but this time split out ‘nonbrand’ and ‘brand’ campaigns seperately. We would like to see how ‘brand’ has been doing since being introduced. (In terms of Website Session volume, Order volume, and Conversion Rate)

(Note: The ‘brand’ and ‘nonbrand’ campaigns are paid advertisements
where ‘brand’ indicates )

``` sql
SELECT
DATE_FORMAT(website_sessions.created_at, '%Y/%m') AS yr_mo,

COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN website_sessions.utm_campaign = 'brand' THEN website_sessions.website_session_id ELSE NULL END) AS brand_sessions,
COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN website_sessions.utm_campaign = 'brand' THEN orders.order_id ELSE NULL END) AS brand_orders,
COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN website_sessions.utm_campaign = 'brand' THEN orders.order_id ELSE NULL END)/
COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN website_sessions.utm_campaign = 'brand' THEN website_sessions.website_session_id ELSE NULL END) AS brand_order_rt,
COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN website_sessions.utm_campaign = 'nonbrand' THEN website_sessions.website_session_id ELSE NULL END) AS nonbrand_sessions,
COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN website_sessions.utm_campaign = 'nonbrand' THEN orders.order_id ELSE NULL END) AS nonbrand_orders,
COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN website_sessions.utm_campaign = 'nonbrand' THEN orders.order_id ELSE NULL END)/
COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN website_sessions.utm_campaign = 'nonbrand' THEN website_sessions.website_session_id ELSE NULL END) AS nonbrand_order_rt

FROM website_sessions
LEFT JOIN orders
ON website_sessions.website_session_id = orders.website_session_id
WHERE website_sessions.utm_source = 'gsearch'
-- AND website_sessions.created_at < '2012-11-28'
GROUP BY 1;

Brand sessions have been increasing but the Conversion Rate has been
volatile but upward trending overall. Nonbrand sessions have had
significant growth in Website Sessions peaking around November/December
of 2012 and settling in the 4000-5000 range. They have, however,
observed consistent growth in Conversion Rate, nearing the 7% mark in
latter
months.

## Objective 3: While on ‘gsearch’, dive into ‘nonbrand’ and pull volumes for Monthly Sessions and Orders along with Conversion Rates split by Device Type (‘mobile’, ‘desktop’)

``` sql

We see fast growth in desktop orders early on and slower growth late,
but with consistent growth in order rate throughout. Mobile order
sessions are volatile all around but have had fewer drop offs in recent
months. There is consistent growth with their order rates despite the
volatility in session
volume.

## Objective 4: Pull monthly trends by volume and Conversion Rate for ‘gsearch’ alongside each of our other channels

(Note: If it is a ‘bsearch’ or ‘gsearch’ session, then they got it via
search engine by clicking on a paid advertisement. If it was through a
search engine but instead of a paid advertisement they clicked on a
normal link, then that is an ‘organic session’. If they directly typed
in the website’s http address then it is a ‘direct session’. )

We see steady growth across the board with ‘direct’ sessions and
‘organic’ sessions having the most impressive conversion rates. This
makes sense since those users were seeking out specifically our company.
However, the vast majority of the traffic comes from ‘bsearch’ and
‘gsearch’.

## Objective 5: Estimate the additional orders we have recieved as a result from switching from ‘/home’ to ‘/lander-1’ as the landing page for ‘gsearch’ and ‘nonbrand’ sessions. (the lander-1 test period was from June 19 to July 28 of 2012)

(Note: here, these url’s represent the first page a user sees when they
get to the site)

This is a multistep problem. First, we need to get the differential in
order rates between the two landing pages.

``` sql
SELECT DISTINCT
land_pg.pageview_url,

COUNT(DISTINCT land_pg.website_session_id) AS sessions,
COUNT(DISTINCT orders.order_id) AS orders,
COUNT(DISTINCT orders.order_id)/COUNT(DISTINCT land_pg.website_session_id) AS order_rt

FROM (
SELECT 
website_sessions.website_session_id,
website_pageviews.pageview_url,

MIN(website_pageviews.website_pageview_id)

FROM website_sessions
LEFT JOIN website_pageviews
ON website_sessions.website_session_id = website_pageviews.website_session_id
WHERE website_sessions.created_at BETWEEN '2012-06-19' AND '2012-07-28' 
AND website_sessions.utm_source = 'gsearch'
AND website_sessions.utm_campaign = 'nonbrand'
AND website_pageviews.pageview_url IN ('/home','/lander-1')
GROUP BY 1,2
) AS land_pg

LEFT JOIN orders
ON orders.website_session_id = land_pg.website_session_id
GROUP BY 1;
```



| pageview\_url | sessions | orders | order\_rt |
| :------------ | -------: | -----: | --------: |
| /home         |     2272 |     73 |    0.0321 |
| /lander-1     |     2304 |     94 |    0.0408 |

Evidently ‘/lander-1’ outperforms ‘/home’ by about .0088 orders per
session.

We would like to see when the last time was that ‘/home’ was used as a
landing page. This will give us our cutoff point for the next query when
we get the total number of ‘/lander-1’ sessions.

``` sql
SELECT
MAX(website_sessions.website_session_id) AS max_session_id

FROM website_sessions
LEFT JOIN website_pageviews
ON website_sessions.website_session_id = website_pageviews.website_session_id
WHERE website_sessions.utm_source = 'gsearch'
AND website_sessions.utm_campaign = 'nonbrand'
AND website_pageviews.pageview_url = '/home';
```



| max\_session\_id |
| :--------------- |
| 17145            |

1 records



So the last ‘/home’ session was at the 17145th website session.

Now we will get the number of ‘/lander-1’ sessions

``` sql
SELECT
COUNT(website_sessions.website_session_id) AS session_count

FROM website_sessions
LEFT JOIN website_pageviews
ON website_sessions.website_session_id = website_pageviews.website_session_id
WHERE website_sessions.utm_source = 'gsearch'
AND website_sessions.website_session_id > 17145
AND website_sessions.utm_campaign = 'nonbrand'
AND website_pageviews.pageview_url = '/lander-1';
```



| session\_count |
| :------------- |
| 35734          |

1 records



35,734 sessions \(\times\) .0088 differential =\> 314 more orders with
‘/lander-1’ than what would’ve been with ‘/home’. Evidence that
‘lander-1’ is in the best interest of the company to use as the
landing page for the
website.

## Objective 6: Create full conversion tunnels for both the ‘/home’ and ‘/lander-1’ (‘gsearch’ and ‘nonbrand’)

(Note: This conversion tunnel takes you through each necessary page in
order to reach a completed order. We would like to compare the tunnels
of the ‘/home’ and ‘/lander-1’ landing pages beginning on June 19, 2012
(since that is when ‘/lander-1’ was first created.)

``` sql

    ELSE 'something else'

It is evident that across the board ‘/lander-1’ has had better
stepthrough’s than ‘/home’. This indicates to us that we should move
forward with featuring the ‘/lander-1’ landing
page.

## Objective 7: Quantify the impact of the billing test (‘/billing’ vs. ‘/billing-2’) by analyzing the lift generated from the test (Sept 10 to Nov 10) in terms of revenue per billing page session

``` sql
SELECT DISTINCT
pageview_url,

COUNT(website_session_id) AS billing_sessions,
COUNT(order_id) AS orders,
SUM(price_usd)/COUNT(pageview_url) AS rev_per_session

FROM(
SELECT 
website_pageviews.created_at,
website_pageviews.website_session_id,
website_pageviews.pageview_url,
orders.order_id,
orders.price_usd

FROM website_pageviews
LEFT JOIN orders
ON orders.website_session_id = website_pageviews.website_session_id
WHERE website_pageviews.created_at BETWEEN '2012-09-10' AND '2012-11-10'
AND website_pageviews.pageview_url IN ('/billing','/billing-2')

) AS billing_pg
GROUP BY 1;
```



| pageview\_url | billing\_sessions | orders | rev\_per\_session |
| :------------ | ----------------: | -----: | ----------------: |
| /billing      |               657 |    301 |          22.90257 |
| /billing-2    |               653 |    410 |          31.38729 |

2 records

The billing test indicates that the second billing page-type, '/billing-2' is more effective in converting more orders. There is more orders by volume and also more money being spent persession as a result.
